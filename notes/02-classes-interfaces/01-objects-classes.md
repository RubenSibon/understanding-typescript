# Objects and classes

## Objects

- "The things you work with in the code"
- Instances of classes
- Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals

## Classes

- "Blueprint for objects"
- Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
- Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier
